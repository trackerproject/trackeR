### Description

The purpose of this package is to provide infrastructure for handling
running, cycling, and swimming data from GPS-enabled tracking devices.

The formats that are currently supported for the training activity files
are .tcx (Training Center XML), Strava .gpx, .db3 and [Golden
Cheetah](http://goldencheetah.org) .json files. After extraction and
appropriate manipulation of the training or competition attributes, the
data are placed into session-based and unit-aware data objects of class
trackeRdata (S3 class). The information in the resultant data objects
can then be visualised, summarised, and analysed through corresponding
flexible and extensible methods.

### Current capabilities

Read:

- Read data from .tcx, Strava .gpx, .db3 or [Golden
  Cheetah](http://goldencheetah.org) .json files.
- Read all supported files in a specified directory.

Sports supported:

- Running
- Cycling
- Swimming

Data processing:

- Automatically identify sessions from timestamps.
- Imputation of data to characterise times when the device is paused or
  remains stationary.
- Correction of GPS-measured distances using elevation data.
- Basic data cleaning capabilities e.g., no negative speeds or
  distances.
- Specify and conveniently change units of measurement.
- Organise data into session-based and unit-aware data objects of class
  trackeRdata.

Analysis:

- Session summaries: distance, duration, time moving, average
  speed/pace/heart rate/cadence/power (overall and moving), work to rest
  ratio, temperature.
- Time spent exercising in user-supplied zones, e.g., heart rate zones
  or speed zones.
- Work capacity above critical power (Wâ€™, W prime)
- Distribution profiles: time spent exercising above thresholds of
  training attributes.
- Concentration profiles: negative derivatives of distribution profiles.
- Functional principal components analysis of distribution and
  concentration profiles.

Visualisation:

- Plot session progression in, e.g., pace, heart rate, etc.
- Plot route covered during session on static and interactive maps from
  various providers.
- Plot session summary statistics.
- Plot date time of sessions in timeline plots.
- Plot time spent exercising in zones.
- Plot distribution/concentration profiles.
- Plot principal components of distribution/concentration profiles.
- Ridgeline (or joy) plots for distribution/concentration profiles.

### Installation

Install the released version from CRAN:

    install.packages("trackeR")

Or the development version from github:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("trackerproject/trackeR")

### Example

Plot workout data

    data(runs, package = "trackeR")
    plot(runs, session = 1:5, what = c("speed", "pace", "altitude"))

![](/Users/yiannis/Repositories/trackeR/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/plots-1.png)

Change the units

    data(runs, package = "trackeR")
    runs0 <- change_units(runs,
                          variable = c("speed", "altitude"),
                          unit = c("km_per_h", "ft"),
                          sport = c("running", "running"))
    plot(runs0, session = 1:5, what = c("speed", "pace", "altitude"))

![](/Users/yiannis/Repositories/trackeR/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/plots_new-1.png)

Summarise sessions

    library("trackeR")
    runs_summary <- summary(runs)
    plot(runs_summary, group = c("total", "moving"),
        what = c("avgSpeed", "distance", "duration", "avgHeartRate"))

![](/Users/yiannis/Repositories/trackeR/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/summary-1.png)

Generate distribution and concentration profiles

    runsT <- threshold(runs)
    dp_runs <- distribution_profile(runsT, what = c("speed", "heart_rate"))
    dp_runs_smooth <- smoother(dp_runs)
    cp_runs <- concentration_profile(dp_runs_smooth)
    plot(cp_runs, multiple = TRUE, smooth = FALSE)

![](/Users/yiannis/Repositories/trackeR/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/cprofile-1.png)

A ridgeline plot of the concentration profiles

    ridges(cp_runs, what = "speed")

![](/Users/yiannis/Repositories/trackeR/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/cprofile-ridges-1.png)

    ridges(cp_runs, what = "heart_rate")

![](/Users/yiannis/Repositories/trackeR/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/cprofile-ridges-hr-1.png)

Explore concentration profiles for speed, e.g., via functional principal
components analysis (PCA)

    ## fit functional PCA
    cp_PCA <- funPCA(cp_runs, what = "speed", nharm = 4)

    ## pick first 2 harmonics/principal components
    round(cp_PCA$varprop, 2)

    ## [1] 0.66 0.25 0.06 0.02

    ## plot harmonics
    plot(cp_PCA, harm = 1:2)

![](/Users/yiannis/Repositories/trackeR/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/funPCA-1.png)

    ## plot scores vs summary statistics
    scores_SP <- data.frame(cp_PCA$scores)
    names(scores_SP) <- paste0("speed_pc", 1:4)
    d <- cbind(runs_summary, scores_SP)

    library("ggplot2")
    ## pc1 ~ session duration (moving)
    ggplot(d) + geom_point(aes(x = as.numeric(durationMoving), y = speed_pc1)) + theme_bw()

![](/Users/yiannis/Repositories/trackeR/README_files/figure-markdown_strict/scores-1.png)

    ## pc2 ~ avg speed (moving)
    ggplot(d) + geom_point(aes(x = avgSpeedMoving, y = speed_pc2)) + theme_bw()
